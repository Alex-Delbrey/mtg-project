# mtg-project
Basically have to go directly into REST API since mtg-sdk-go is extremely depricated.

Goal: \
    Basic - have a cli app that can search cards on mtg server and save to a postgres db the results, which would be my personal deck. Potentially having tables with decks, and each deck would be a a reference to a table of cards.
